#Types
Python has 5 data types-Numbers, Strings, Lists, Tuple, Dictionary. In this chapter, we will discuss Numbers and Strings. We will see the other 3 in the next chapter.

##Numbers
Numbers are further divided into 4-int, long, float, complex.
```{python}
a = 12
print type(a)
b = 12.3
print type(b)
c = 2323231211142342424
print type(c)
d = complex(2,3)
print d
print type(d)
```

##Strings
Python doesn't differete between single quotes and double quotes. Unlike in C, the is not difference between char ans string-both are same.
```{python}
name = "sreekanth"
occupation = 'software engineer'
print type(name)
qoute = "I'am good" #observe that a single can be used within doubles
print "qoute:" + qoute
qoute = "qoute:" + 'He said "I am not going" to her'
print qoute
```

```{python, eval=FALSE}
qoute = "He said "I am not going" to her"
#this will not work.
```











# Lists
lists are similar to C arrays but more powerful. Lists store multiple values. unlike C arrays, elements in a python list don't have be of the same type. lists are indexed from 0.
```{python}
fruits = ['apple', 'mango', 'pineapple']
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
#elements in a list can be accessed using index.
print numbers[1]
#even negative index is allowed, in which case length of list is added
#to the index. 
print numbers[-1]
fruitsandnumbers =  ['apple', 'mango', 'pineapple', 10, 20, 30, True]
#mixing elements of different types is fine
print fruitsandnumbers
print len(numbers)
#len is a built-in function used to find the length of lists.
```

## Slicing
Slicing is simple way of creating a new list from (part of) an old list.

>```newList = oldList[start:end]```

```{python}
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
sublist = numbers[1:4]
print sublist
print numbers[0:3]
print numbers[:3] #missing starting number, with replaced with 0
print numbers[4:7]
print numbers[4:] #missing ending number is replaced with length of the list.
#negative indices can also be given. 
#In which case, the length of the list is added
print numbers[-2:7] 
print numbers[:-1]  #this will print all elements except the last one.
```
As shown in the example, sublist is a new list consisting of elements 1 to 3(remember, 'end' is not inclusive) in the numbers list. you can also specify negative numbers for indexes in which case, the length of list is automatically added. For example `numbers[-2:7]` is equivalent to `numbers[5:7]`. 

## List methods
Lists are not fixed in length. They increase and decrease when elements are added and removed.
```{python}
numbers = [10,20,30,40,50]
numbers.append(60)  #adds 60 at the end of the list
print numbers
numbers.insert(2, 25) #you can even specify an index
print numbers
#there isn't a method to remove element from an index but you 
#use slicing
numbers = numbers[:1] + numbers[2:]
print numbers #this will remove element at index 1.
print numbers.pop() #removes and returns the last element in the list
print numbers
# More methods
print numbers.index(40) #returns the index of the element 20 if present
numbers.sort()  #sorts list
print numbers
```


# Sets
Sets are like lists but duplicates are not allowed.

```{python}
presentees = {1,5,6, 7, 10, 1, 6, 6, 5}
print presentees
presentees.add(10)
print presentees

```



## Strings as lists
In python, strings are lists. So, all the list operations can be done on strings.
```{python}
name = "sreekanth"
print name[0]
print name[1:5] #slicing
print name + "kolamala" # concatination
#

```

```{python}
a = 12
def add(a,b):
  return a + b
print add(2,3)
```

```{java}
System.out.println("hi");
int a = 10;
int hex = 0x7FFFFFFF; //the max int
```

```{javascript}
var a = 10;
console.log(a)
```







## R Markdown
```{#numCode .R .numberLines}
> print("hello world")
```
```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
print("hello world")
```



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
